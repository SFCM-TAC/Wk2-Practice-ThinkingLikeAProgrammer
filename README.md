Instructions:
1. Fill in answers to the 'About You' questions in 'index.html' so I can get to know you better!
2. Think about the questions in 'Think Like a Programmer' and give detailed answers to how you would approach the problem. There is no right answer for these; I just want to get you thinking about how to translate ideas into a language that computers understand. There are examples of similar problems in the reading.
3. Make 'index.html' look nicer. Right now, it is plain HTML, which means it has all the content but doesn't have any styling. Feel free to be as creative as you want; this is a great chance to dig into what you can do with styling (check out https://www.w3schools.com/css/ for inspiration and reference). Add CSS rules to 'css/styles.css' and feel free to edit the HTML tags in 'index.html' as well. You can also add image files to the 'images' folder and link to them from your HTML (e.g. ```<img src="images/YOURFILENAME">```). For the purpose of grading this assignment you must include:
* At least five css rules (five different property/value combinations)
* At least one change to the HTML

Turn your assignment in by committing your code and pushing it to origin/master as shown in class. Then mark the assignment as 'DONE' in Google Classroom.
