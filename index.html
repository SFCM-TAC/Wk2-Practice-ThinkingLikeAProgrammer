      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
